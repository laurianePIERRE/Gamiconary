Mip-mapping solves that problem by precomputing (that is, prefiltering) different levels of detail of your texture image, and accessing the appropriate level according to the object's distance from the camera. For example, a texture image, which is 16x16 texels, will have four more mip-maps at lower resolutions, 8x8, 4x4, 2x2 and 1x1. Bilinear mip-mapping chooses the closest mip-map image to your pixel's level of detail, and then performs a bilinear interpolation upon that texture image to get the color value for the pixel. Trilinear mip-mapping requires over twice the computational cost, as it chooses the two closest mip-maps, performs a bilinear interpolation on each, then averages the two results to arrive at the final screen pixel value."},

Sometimes mechanical systems are used, but the most common capture method uses an array of video cameras operating in infrared frequencies to capture the motion of special markers (usually balls of reflective tape) in 3D space. The object being captured (a human making a pitching motion, for instance), has several reflective balls attached at key points, like the head, hands, joints, etc., and is then filmed by the cameras (most often an array of six cameras is used). The video is composited by a computer, and since the base position of the cameras is known, the 3D location of the balls can be interpolated by the difference in ball position in the camera views in each frame. The end result from motion capture is basically the motion of the skeleton of the thing captured, around which can be \"wrapped\" a 3D modeled character, to generate extremely life-like animation.

Mip-mapping solves that problem by precomputing (that is, prefiltering) different levels of detail of your texture image, and accessing the appropriate level according to the object's distance from the camera. For example, a texture image, which is 16x16 texels, will have four more mip-maps at lower resolutions, 8x8, 4x4, 2x2 and 1x1. Bilinear mip-mapping chooses the closest mip-map image to your pixel's level of detail, and then performs a bilinear interpolation upon that texture image to get the color value for the pixel.

The object being captured (a human making a pitching motion, for instance), has several reflective balls attached at key points, like the head, hands, joints, etc., and is then filmed by the cameras (most often an array of six cameras is used). The video is composited by a computer, and since the base position of the cameras is known, the 3D location of the balls can be interpolated by the difference in ball position in the camera views in each frame. The end result from motion capture is basically the motion of the skeleton of the thing captured, around which can be \"wrapped\" a 3D modeled character, to generate extremely life-like animation.

Mip-mapping solves that problem by precomputing (that is, prefiltering) different levels of detail of your texture image, and accessing the appropriate level according to the object's distance from the camera. For example, a texture image, which is 16x16 texels, will have four more mip-maps at lower resolutions, 8x8, 4x4, 2x2 and 1x1. Bilinear mip-mapping chooses the closest mip-map image to your pixel's level of detail, and then performs a bilinear interpolation upon that texture image to get the color value for the pixel.

For example, a texture image, which is 16x16 texels, will have four more mip-maps at lower resolutions, 8x8, 4x4, 2x2 and 1x1. Bilinear mip-mapping chooses the closest mip-map image to your pixel's level of detail, and then performs a bilinear interpolation upon that texture image to get the color value for the pixel. Trilinear mip-mapping requires over twice the computational cost, as it chooses the two closest mip-maps, performs a bilinear interpolation on each, then averages the two results to arrive at the final screen pixel value."},

{"EN": "PlayStation", "definition": "The third aspect is called specular highlighting, which takes into account the angle between the light-source and the \"eye\" of the viewer, so that if the light bounces off a particular spot on the object straight into the \"camera\" it will be illuminated 100%, and less so if it misses the camera."},
{"EN": "PlayStation 2", "definition": "The Phong lighting model is fairly realistic for games, but fails to account for the fact that in real life, reflections off of steel or other metals change color depending on what angle they're viewed from, while specular highlighting always gives a reflection of the same color. Phong lighting works only on the vertices of a polygon (using Gouraud shading to color the rest of the polygon), so if a highlight happens to fall in the middle of the polygon, it will be missed, which requires programmers to \"tessellate\" or break-up large polygons into many small ones to be sure of \"catching\" highlights at vertices. However, Phong lighting is very fast and doesn't require much processor power."},

{"EN": "RCA Cord", "definition": "A processor architecture in which the amount of operations the processor can perform on data is limited, but which is much faster than standard CISC chips. Preparing instructions for a RISC processor takes far longer than with a CISC processor, since a RISC processor can handle fewer commands. Since most computer programs are written in C++ or another high-end language, the only thing that needs to talk to the processor is the program (called a compiler) which translates the C++ into machine language. This makes using fast RISC chips, like the Power PC, much more attractive. RISC chips are smaller and run cooler than CISC chips with comparable power."},
{"EN": "RCP", "definition": "This is memory data that can be read by the CPU, but cannot be rewritten over. Traditionally, ROM was found only inside computers.

Console RPGs, heavily influenced by Japanese games like the Phantasy Star and Final Fantasy series, tend to have a strong emphasis on storyline and character interaction, while PC RPGs, typified by the Might and Magic series, more heavily favor statistical bookkeeping and tightly constructed puzzle solving."},

Lack of perspective correction is most apparent when looking at a texture-mapped object, which recedes far into the distance, like the ground or a wall."},
{"EN": "Photoshop", "definition": "Developed by Bui-ti Phong in 1972, a method of lighting a 3D world, the Phong lighting model applies three different types of lighting to the vertex of every polygon. Phong lighting works by performing operations based on the normal of the polygon, the \"normal\" being an imaginary line drawn orthogonal (straight up from) the face of the polygon."},
{"EN": "Pikachu Nintendo 64", "definition": "The first of the three lighting types is ambient light — light which is put there by a programmer. It affects every polygon equally."},
{"EN": "Pippin", "definition": "Diffuse lighting is the second type. It assumes that there is no reflection from the objects it is lighting (clay is an example of a nearly perfect diffuse surface), but it does take into consideration the angle that the light hits the surface. If it fully hits, it will be 100% illuminated, if the object is turned slightly, it will be less illuminated, etc."},
{"EN": "Pirate", "definition": "The third aspect is called specular highlighting, which takes into account the angle between the light-source and the \"eye\" of the viewer, so that if the light bounces off a particular spot on the object straight into the \"camera\" it will be illuminated 100%, and less so if it misses the camera."},
{"EN": "Pixel", "definition": "The Phong lighting model is fairly realistic for games, but fails to account for the fact that in real life, reflections off of steel or other metals change color depending on what angle they're viewed from, while specular highlighting always gives a reflection of the same color. Phong lighting works only on the vertices of a polygon (using Gouraud shading to color the rest of the polygon), so if a highlight happens to fall in the middle of the polygon, it will be missed, which requires programmers to \"tessellate\" or break-up large polygons into many small ones to be sure of \"catching\" highlights at vertices. However, Phong lighting is very fast and doesn't require much processor power."},

{"EN": "Z-buffering", "definition": "When dealing with 3D graphics, it's very important that the computer not draw polygons that can't be seen by the user (that are off the screen or behind other polygons closer to the user's point of reference), since drawing, or rasterizing, polygons to the screen takes a lot of time."},
{"EN": "Zoning", "definition": "To avoid this in conventional 3D programming, the developers must take special care to note how polygons are drawn to the screen, in what order they are drawn, and they must keep a list, in memory, of the \"order\" in which the polygons go along the z-axis, so that time is not wasted drawing hidden polygons."},
{"EN": "Z-axis", "definition": "Z-buffering is a hardware routine that takes care of the chores of knowing which polygons to draw and which to omit automatically.

{"EN": "PRDS", "definition": "Developed by Bui-ti Phong in 1972, a method of lighting a 3D world, the Phong lighting model applies three different types of lighting to the vertex of every polygon. Phong lighting works by performing operations based on the normal of the polygon, the \"normal\" being an imaginary line drawn orthogonal (straight up from) the face of the polygon."},
{"EN": "Prerendered", "definition": "The first of the three lighting types is ambient light — light which is put there by a programmer. It affects every polygon equally."},
{"EN": "Prestige (n), Prestiging (v)", "definition": "Diffuse lighting is the second type. It assumes that there is no reflection from the objects it is lighting (clay is an example of a nearly perfect diffuse surface), but it does take into consideration the angle that the light hits the surface. If it fully hits, it will be 100% illuminated, if the object is turned slightly, it will be less illuminated, etc."},
{"EN": "Preview", "definition": "The third aspect is called specular highlighting, which takes into account the angle between the light-source and the \"eye\" of the viewer, so that if the light bounces off a particular spot on the object straight into the \"camera\" it will be illuminated 100%, and less so if it misses the camera."},
{"EN": "Price Point", "definition": "The Phong lighting model is fairly realistic for games, but fails to account for the fact that in real life, reflections off of steel or other metals change color depending on what angle they're viewed from, while specular highlighting always gives a reflection of the same color. Phong lighting works only on the vertices of a polygon (using Gouraud shading to color the rest of the polygon), so if a highlight happens to fall in the middle of the polygon, it will be missed, which requires programmers to \"tessellate\" or break-up large polygons into many small ones to be sure of \"catching\" highlights at vertices. However, Phong lighting is very fast and doesn't require much processor power."},

{"EN": "Interpolation", "definition": "Generically, it determines from two or more values what the \"in-between\" values should be. Gamers will be more concerned with graphic interpolation, particularly the \"bilinear\" interpolation of texture maps, which reduces the blocky Doom effect. For instance, when one approaches a wall in Doom, the texture maps scale up to such a degree that a single texel is often spread over many pixels, causing the wall to look extremely blocky and destroying the realism of the scene. Bilinear interpolation (so called because it works in two dimensions, x and y) lessens this effect by looking — for each pixel - at the texel, which should be drawn to it, but also at the three other nearest texels. It then interpolates this texel data to determine a color for the pixel, so that two adjacent pixels, which would have had the same color if the texture map was point-sampled, will likely have different colors when the texture-map is bilinearly interpolated. The end result is that when viewed at close range, the texture map has an apparently higher resolution than it actually does, keeping magnified texture maps from looking blocky."},

Sometimes mechanical systems are used, but the most common capture method uses an array of video cameras operating in infrared frequencies to capture the motion of special markers (usually balls of reflective tape) in 3D space. The object being captured (a human making a pitching motion, for instance), has several reflective balls attached at key points, like the head, hands, joints, etc., and is then filmed by the cameras (most often an array of six cameras is used). The video is composited by a computer, and since the base position of the cameras is known, the 3D location of the balls can be interpolated by the difference in ball position in the camera views in each frame. The end result from motion capture is basically the motion of the skeleton of the thing captured, around which can be \"wrapped\" a 3D modeled character, to generate extremely life-like animation.

{"EN": "MPEG (Moving Pictures Experts Group)", "definition": "When viewing a distant texture-mapped object in a 3D world, many texels make up each pixel seen on the screen, causing the textures to often appear aliased or distorted, if point sampling, the most common texture-mapping technique, is used. Mip-mapping solves that problem by precomputing (that is, prefiltering) different levels of detail of your texture image, and accessing the appropriate level according to the object's distance from the camera. For example, a texture image, which is 16x16 texels, will have four more mip-maps at lower resolutions, 8x8, 4x4, 2x2 and 1x1. Bilinear mip-mapping chooses the closest mip-map image to your pixel's level of detail, and then performs a bilinear interpolation upon that texture image to get the color value for the pixel. Trilinear mip-mapping requires over twice the computational cost, as it chooses the two closest mip-maps, performs a bilinear interpolation on each, then averages the two results to arrive at the final screen pixel value."},

{"EN": "Publisher", "definition": "The third aspect is called specular highlighting, which takes into account the angle between the light-source and the \"eye\" of the viewer, so that if the light bounces off a particular spot on the object straight into the \"camera\" it will be illuminated 100%, and less so if it misses the camera."},
{"EN": "Puzzle", "definition": "The Phong lighting model is fairly realistic for games, but fails to account for the fact that in real life, reflections off of steel or other metals change color depending on what angle they're viewed from, while specular highlighting always gives a reflection of the same color. Phong lighting works only on the vertices of a polygon (using Gouraud shading to color the rest of the polygon), so if a highlight happens to fall in the middle of the polygon, it will be missed, which requires programmers to \"tessellate\" or break-up large polygons into many small ones to be sure of \"catching\" highlights at vertices. However, Phong lighting is very fast and doesn't require much processor power."},

{"EN": "Price Point", "definition": "The Phong lighting model is fairly realistic for games, but fails to account for the fact that in real life, reflections off of steel or other metals change color depending on what angle they're viewed from, while specular highlighting always gives a reflection of the same color. Phong lighting works only on the vertices of a polygon (using Gouraud shading to color the rest of the polygon), so if a highlight happens to fall in the middle of the polygon, it will be missed, which requires programmers to \"tessellate\" or break-up large polygons into many small ones to be sure of \"catching\" highlights at vertices. However, Phong lighting is very fast and doesn't require much processor power."},

{"EN": "Interpolation", "definition": "Generically, it determines from two or more values what the \"in-between\" values should be. Gamers will be more concerned with graphic interpolation, particularly the \"bilinear\" interpolation of texture maps, which reduces the blocky Doom effect. For instance, when one approaches a wall in Doom, the texture maps scale up to such a degree that a single texel is often spread over many pixels, causing the wall to look extremely blocky and destroying the realism of the scene. Bilinear interpolation (so called because it works in two dimensions, x and y) lessens this effect by looking — for each pixel - at the texel, which should be drawn to it, but also at the three other nearest texels. It then interpolates this texel data to determine a color for the pixel, so that two adjacent pixels, which would have had the same color if the texture map was point-sampled, will likely have different colors when the texture-map is bilinearly interpolated. The end result is that when viewed at close range, the texture map has an apparently higher resolution than it actually does, keeping magnified texture maps from looking blocky."},

For instance, when one approaches a wall in Doom, the texture maps scale up to such a degree that a single texel is often spread over many pixels, causing the wall to look extremely blocky and destroying the realism of the scene. Bilinear interpolation (so called because it works in two dimensions, x and y) lessens this effect by looking — for each pixel - at the texel, which should be drawn to it, but also at the three other nearest texels. It then interpolates this texel data to determine a color for the pixel, so that two adjacent pixels, which would have had the same color if the texture map was point-sampled, will likely have different colors when the texture-map is bilinearly interpolated. The end result is that when viewed at close range, the texture map has an apparently higher resolution than it actually does, keeping magnified texture maps from looking blocky."},

Mip-mapping solves that problem by precomputing (that is, prefiltering) different levels of detail of your texture image, and accessing the appropriate level according to the object's distance from the camera. For example, a texture image, which is 16x16 texels, will have four more mip-maps at lower resolutions, 8x8, 4x4, 2x2 and 1x1. Bilinear mip-mapping chooses the closest mip-map image to your pixel's level of detail, and then performs a bilinear interpolation upon that texture image to get the color value for the pixel.

Sometimes mechanical systems are used, but the most common capture method uses an array of video cameras operating in infrared frequencies to capture the motion of special markers (usually balls of reflective tape) in 3D space. The object being captured (a human making a pitching motion, for instance), has several reflective balls attached at key points, like the head, hands, joints, etc., and is then filmed by the cameras (most often an array of six cameras is used). The video is composited by a computer, and since the base position of the cameras is known, the 3D location of the balls can be interpolated by the difference in ball position in the camera views in each frame. The end result from motion capture is basically the motion of the skeleton of the thing captured, around which can be \"wrapped\" a 3D modeled character, to generate extremely life-like animation.

Mip-mapping solves that problem by precomputing (that is, prefiltering) different levels of detail of your texture image, and accessing the appropriate level according to the object's distance from the camera. For example, a texture image, which is 16x16 texels, will have four more mip-maps at lower resolutions, 8x8, 4x4, 2x2 and 1x1. Bilinear mip-mapping chooses the closest mip-map image to your pixel's level of detail, and then performs a bilinear interpolation upon that texture image to get the color value for the pixel. Trilinear mip-mapping requires over twice the computational cost, as it chooses the two closest mip-maps, performs a bilinear interpolation on each, then averages the two results to arrive at the final screen pixel value."},

{"EN": "Scan-line Conversion", "definition": "Process used to take vertices defining a polygon, and fill the polygon in. In simple terms lines are \"drawn\" between the vertices, and the minimum X value (in 2 space) and the maximum X value are recorded.

Sometimes mechanical systems are used, but the most common capture method uses an array of video cameras operating in infrared frequencies to capture the motion of special markers (usually balls of reflective tape) in 3D space. The object being captured (a human making a pitching motion, for instance), has several reflective balls attached at key points, like the head, hands, joints, etc., and is then filmed by the cameras (most often an array of six cameras is used). The video is composited by a computer, and since the base position of the cameras is known, the 3D location of the balls can be interpolated by the difference in ball position in the camera views in each frame. The end result from motion capture is basically the motion of the skeleton of the thing captured, around which can be \"wrapped\" a 3D modeled character, to generate extremely life-like animation.

Mip-mapping solves that problem by precomputing (that is, prefiltering) different levels of detail of your texture image, and accessing the appropriate level according to the object's distance from the camera. For example, a texture image, which is 16x16 texels, will have four more mip-maps at lower resolutions, 8x8, 4x4, 2x2 and 1x1. Bilinear mip-mapping chooses the closest mip-map image to your pixel's level of detail, and then performs a bilinear interpolation upon that texture image to get the color value for the pixel. Trilinear mip-mapping requires over twice the computational cost, as it chooses the two closest mip-maps, performs a bilinear interpolation on each, then averages the two results to arrive at the final screen pixel value."},

{"EN": "MUD (Multi-user Dungeon)", "definition": "A process by which an object's motion through 3D space is digitized. Sometimes mechanical systems are used, but the most common capture method uses an array of video cameras operating in infrared frequencies to capture the motion of special markers (usually balls of reflective tape) in 3D space. The object being captured (a human making a pitching motion, for instance), has several reflective balls attached at key points, like the head, hands, joints, etc., and is then filmed by the cameras (most often an array of six cameras is used). The video is composited by a computer, and since the base position of the cameras is known, the 3D location of the balls can be interpolated by the difference in ball position in the camera views in each frame. The end result from motion capture is basically the motion of the skeleton of the thing captured, around which can be \"wrapped\" a 3D modeled character, to generate extremely life-like animation.

{"EN": "Motion Capture", "definition": "When viewing a distant texture-mapped object in a 3D world, many texels make up each pixel seen on the screen, causing the textures to often appear aliased or distorted, if point sampling, the most common texture-mapping technique, is used. Mip-mapping solves that problem by precomputing (that is, prefiltering) different levels of detail of your texture image, and accessing the appropriate level according to the object's distance from the camera. For example, a texture image, which is 16x16 texels, will have four more mip-maps at lower resolutions, 8x8, 4x4, 2x2 and 1x1. Bilinear mip-mapping chooses the closest mip-map image to your pixel's level of detail, and then performs a bilinear interpolation upon that texture image to get the color value for the pixel. Trilinear mip-mapping requires over twice the computational cost, as it chooses the two closest mip-maps, performs a bilinear interpolation on each, then averages the two results to arrive at the final screen pixel value."},

Sometimes mechanical systems are used, but the most common capture method uses an array of video cameras operating in infrared frequencies to capture the motion of special markers (usually balls of reflective tape) in 3D space. The object being captured (a human making a pitching motion, for instance), has several reflective balls attached at key points, like the head, hands, joints, etc., and is then filmed by the cameras (most often an array of six cameras is used). The video is composited by a computer, and since the base position of the cameras is known, the 3D location of the balls can be interpolated by the difference in ball position in the camera views in each frame. The end result from motion capture is basically the motion of the skeleton of the thing captured, around which can be \"wrapped\" a 3D modeled character, to generate extremely life-like animation.

Mip-mapping solves that problem by precomputing (that is, prefiltering) different levels of detail of your texture image, and accessing the appropriate level according to the object's distance from the camera. For example, a texture image, which is 16x16 texels, will have four more mip-maps at lower resolutions, 8x8, 4x4, 2x2 and 1x1. Bilinear mip-mapping chooses the closest mip-map image to your pixel's level of detail, and then performs a bilinear interpolation upon that texture image to get the color value for the pixel. Trilinear mip-mapping requires over twice the computational cost, as it chooses the two closest mip-maps, performs a bilinear interpolation on each, then averages the two results to arrive at the final screen pixel value."},

Sometimes mechanical systems are used, but the most common capture method uses an array of video cameras operating in infrared frequencies to capture the motion of special markers (usually balls of reflective tape) in 3D space. The object being captured (a human making a pitching motion, for instance), has several reflective balls attached at key points, like the head, hands, joints, etc., and is then filmed by the cameras (most often an array of six cameras is used). The video is composited by a computer, and since the base position of the cameras is known, the 3D location of the balls can be interpolated by the difference in ball position in the camera views in each frame. The end result from motion capture is basically the motion of the skeleton of the thing captured, around which can be \"wrapped\" a 3D modeled character, to generate extremely life-like animation.

Lack of perspective correction is most apparent when looking at a texture-mapped object, which recedes far into the distance, like the ground or a wall."},
{"EN": "Platformer", "definition": "Developed by Bui-ti Phong in 1972, a method of lighting a 3D world, the Phong lighting model applies three different types of lighting to the vertex of every polygon. Phong lighting works by performing operations based on the normal of the polygon, the \"normal\" being an imaginary line drawn orthogonal (straight up from) the face of the polygon."},
{"EN": "Platinum", "definition": "The first of the three lighting types is ambient light — light which is put there by a programmer. It affects every polygon equally."},
{"EN": "Player Killing", "definition": "Diffuse lighting is the second type. It assumes that there is no reflection from the objects it is lighting (clay is an example of a nearly perfect diffuse surface), but it does take into consideration the angle that the light hits the surface. If it fully hits, it will be 100% illuminated, if the object is turned slightly, it will be less illuminated, etc."},
{"EN": "PlayStation", "definition": "The third aspect is called specular highlighting, which takes into account the angle between the light-source and the \"eye\" of the viewer, so that if the light bounces off a particular spot on the object straight into the \"camera\" it will be illuminated 100%, and less so if it misses the camera."},
{"EN": "PlayStation 2", "definition": "The Phong lighting model is fairly realistic for games, but fails to account for the fact that in real life, reflections off of steel or other metals change color depending on what angle they're viewed from, while specular highlighting always gives a reflection of the same color. Phong lighting works only on the vertices of a polygon (using Gouraud shading to color the rest of the polygon), so if a highlight happens to fall in the middle of the polygon, it will be missed, which requires programmers to \"tessellate\" or break-up large polygons into many small ones to be sure of \"catching\" highlights at vertices. However, Phong lighting is very fast and doesn't require much processor power."},

Mip-mapping solves that problem by precomputing (that is, prefiltering) different levels of detail of your texture image, and accessing the appropriate level according to the object's distance from the camera. For example, a texture image, which is 16x16 texels, will have four more mip-maps at lower resolutions, 8x8, 4x4, 2x2 and 1x1. Bilinear mip-mapping chooses the closest mip-map image to your pixel's level of detail, and then performs a bilinear interpolation upon that texture image to get the color value for the pixel. Trilinear mip-mapping requires over twice the computational cost, as it chooses the two closest mip-maps, performs a bilinear interpolation on each, then averages the two results to arrive at the final screen pixel value."},

{"EN": "Puzzle", "definition": "The Phong lighting model is fairly realistic for games, but fails to account for the fact that in real life, reflections off of steel or other metals change color depending on what angle they're viewed from, while specular highlighting always gives a reflection of the same color. Phong lighting works only on the vertices of a polygon (using Gouraud shading to color the rest of the polygon), so if a highlight happens to fall in the middle of the polygon, it will be missed, which requires programmers to \"tessellate\" or break-up large polygons into many small ones to be sure of \"catching\" highlights at vertices. However, Phong lighting is very fast and doesn't require much processor power."},

{"EN": "PRDS", "definition": "Developed by Bui-ti Phong in 1972, a method of lighting a 3D world, the Phong lighting model applies three different types of lighting to the vertex of every polygon.

{"EN": "Prestige (n), Prestiging (v)", "definition": "Diffuse lighting is the second type. It assumes that there is no reflection from the objects it is lighting (clay is an example of a nearly perfect diffuse surface), but it does take into consideration the angle that the light hits the surface. If it fully hits, it will be 100% illuminated, if the object is turned slightly, it will be less illuminated, etc."},
{"EN": "Preview", "definition": "The third aspect is called specular highlighting, which takes into account the angle between the light-source and the \"eye\" of the viewer, so that if the light bounces off a particular spot on the object straight into the \"camera\" it will be illuminated 100%, and less so if it misses the camera."},
{"EN": "Price Point", "definition": "The Phong lighting model is fairly realistic for games, but fails to account for the fact that in real life, reflections off of steel or other metals change color depending on what angle they're viewed from, while specular highlighting always gives a reflection of the same color. Phong lighting works only on the vertices of a polygon (using Gouraud shading to color the rest of the polygon), so if a highlight happens to fall in the middle of the polygon, it will be missed, which requires programmers to \"tessellate\" or break-up large polygons into many small ones to be sure of \"catching\" highlights at vertices. However, Phong lighting is very fast and doesn't require much processor power."},

Bilinear interpolation (so called because it works in two dimensions, x and y) lessens this effect by looking — for each pixel - at the texel, which should be drawn to it, but also at the three other nearest texels. It then interpolates this texel data to determine a color for the pixel, so that two adjacent pixels, which would have had the same color if the texture map was point-sampled, will likely have different colors when the texture-map is bilinearly interpolated.

For instance, when one approaches a wall in Doom, the texture maps scale up to such a degree that a single texel is often spread over many pixels, causing the wall to look extremely blocky and destroying the realism of the scene. Bilinear interpolation (so called because it works in two dimensions, x and y) lessens this effect by looking — for each pixel - at the texel, which should be drawn to it, but also at the three other nearest texels. It then interpolates this texel data to determine a color for the pixel, so that two adjacent pixels, which would have had the same color if the texture map was point-sampled, will likely have different colors when the texture-map is bilinearly interpolated. The end result is that when viewed at close range, the texture map has an apparently higher resolution than it actually does, keeping magnified texture maps from looking blocky."},

Mip-mapping solves that problem by precomputing (that is, prefiltering) different levels of detail of your texture image, and accessing the appropriate level according to the object's distance from the camera. For example, a texture image, which is 16x16 texels, will have four more mip-maps at lower resolutions, 8x8, 4x4, 2x2 and 1x1. Bilinear mip-mapping chooses the closest mip-map image to your pixel's level of detail, and then performs a bilinear interpolation upon that texture image to get the color value for the pixel. Trilinear mip-mapping requires over twice the computational cost, as it chooses the two closest mip-maps, performs a bilinear interpolation on each, then averages the two results to arrive at the final screen pixel value."},

The video is composited by a computer, and since the base position of the cameras is known, the 3D location of the balls can be interpolated by the difference in ball position in the camera views in each frame. The end result from motion capture is basically the motion of the skeleton of the thing captured, around which can be \"wrapped\" a 3D modeled character, to generate extremely life-like animation.

(\"Pixel 1, line 1 has a color value of X, pixel 2 line 1 has a color value of Y, etc.) Backgrounds and sprites are examples of bitmaps. Storing bitmaps takes a very large amount of computer memory."},

It allows the game to \"walk\" a tree which tells how objects relate to one another in the 3D world. The file ends up looking graphically like a tree, with recursive branches going out all over. To perform the action, a head object is chosen. The program follows the tree, and must decide to go left or right down the tree. By progressing in this manner, all objects can be drawn in proper order, eliminating improper polygon drawing. This technique is used in games such as Quake. Note: BSP Trees can only be used for objects which do not move such as walls or immovable objects in an arena."},

Mip-mapping solves that problem by precomputing (that is, prefiltering) different levels of detail of your texture image, and accessing the appropriate level according to the object's distance from the camera. For example, a texture image, which is 16x16 texels, will have four more mip-maps at lower resolutions, 8x8, 4x4, 2x2 and 1x1. Bilinear mip-mapping chooses the closest mip-map image to your pixel's level of detail, and then performs a bilinear interpolation upon that texture image to get the color value for the pixel. Trilinear mip-mapping requires over twice the computational cost, as it chooses the two closest mip-maps, performs a bilinear interpolation on each, then averages the two results to arrive at the final screen pixel value."},

For example, a texture image, which is 16x16 texels, will have four more mip-maps at lower resolutions, 8x8, 4x4, 2x2 and 1x1. Bilinear mip-mapping chooses the closest mip-map image to your pixel's level of detail, and then performs a bilinear interpolation upon that texture image to get the color value for the pixel.

Phong lighting works only on the vertices of a polygon (using Gouraud shading to color the rest of the polygon), so if a highlight happens to fall in the middle of the polygon, it will be missed, which requires programmers to \"tessellate\" or break-up large polygons into many small ones to be sure of \"catching\" highlights at vertices.

{"EN": "Project Reality", "definition": "The standard method for mapping a texture map to a 3D object. Only one point on the texture map is looked at per pixel. When the object being mapped is very close to the camera, the same textel is mapped to many pixels, resulting in the blocky close-ups found in Doom and other games. When the object being viewed is far from the camera, the distance between textels represented in contiguous pixels is too great, resulting in a swimming, aliased effect. Contrast with interpolation, mip-mapping."},

{"EN": "PRDS", "definition": "Developed by Bui-ti Phong in 1972, a method of lighting a 3D world, the Phong lighting model applies three different types of lighting to the vertex of every polygon.

{"EN": "Prestige (n), Prestiging (v)", "definition": "Diffuse lighting is the second type. It assumes that there is no reflection from the objects it is lighting (clay is an example of a nearly perfect diffuse surface), but it does take into consideration the angle that the light hits the surface. If it fully hits, it will be 100% illuminated, if the object is turned slightly, it will be less illuminated, etc."},
{"EN": "Preview", "definition": "The third aspect is called specular highlighting, which takes into account the angle between the light-source and the \"eye\" of the viewer, so that if the light bounces off a particular spot on the object straight into the \"camera\" it will be illuminated 100%, and less so if it misses the camera."},
{"EN": "Price Point", "definition": "The Phong lighting model is fairly realistic for games, but fails to account for the fact that in real life, reflections off of steel or other metals change color depending on what angle they're viewed from, while specular highlighting always gives a reflection of the same color. Phong lighting works only on the vertices of a polygon (using Gouraud shading to color the rest of the polygon), so if a highlight happens to fall in the middle of the polygon, it will be missed, which requires programmers to \"tessellate\" or break-up large polygons into many small ones to be sure of \"catching\" highlights at vertices. However, Phong lighting is very fast and doesn't require much processor power."},
